# ESP32 Firmware Source Placeholder

This directory intentionally remains empty until the ESP32 port of the SkyFeeder firmware is implemented. Keeping the folder in git prevents build tooling from failing when it expects a `src/` path during Arduino CLI discovery. Add new sketches or components here as they become available.
